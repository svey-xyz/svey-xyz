Hey! 👋 I'm **@svey** online, and Hayden if you know me 🌎.

I am a digital media artist, and web developer.

My field of work covers everything from large scale interactive public installations, to more humble independent websites. My background is in visual arts and software development and has provided me with both the vision, and technical know-how, to provide unique digital experiences.

If you want to learn more about the kind of work that I offer, you can take a 👀 around [my site](https://svey.xyz), checkout [my GitHub](https://github.com/svey-xyz), or reach out to me by email at [x@svey.xyz](mailto:x@svey.xyz) ✍️. I am currently available for contract, and I am eager to meet you and help you create your next digital experience!
